# MongoDB $in Operator with Single-Element Array

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with arrays containing only one element.

## The Problem

The `$in` operator is typically used to check if a field's value exists within an array of values. However, when the array has only one element, using `$in` is redundant and might not produce the desired results.

## The Solution

For single-value checks, it's more efficient and clearer to use the `$eq` operator or simply compare the field directly to the value. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bug.js` to see the incorrect query.
3. Run `bugSolution.js` to see the correct and more efficient solution.
